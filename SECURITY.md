## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Disclose Publicly

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Report Privately

Email security reports to: security@yourdomain.com (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity

### 4. Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and validate the issue
- We will work on a fix
- We will notify you when the fix is ready
- We will coordinate public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Authentication & Authorization

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper JWT token validation
- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt with salt)
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints

#### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

#### Session Management

- Set appropriate JWT expiration times
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Clear tokens on logout
- Use secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)

#### OAuth2 Integration

- Validate OAuth2 state parameter
- Use HTTPS redirect URIs
- Store tokens securely
- Implement token refresh
- Validate token signatures

#### File Uploads

- Validate file types and sizes
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store uploads outside web root
- Generate random filenames
- Implement proper access controls

#### Database Security

- Use strong database passwords
- Limit database user privileges
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Regular backup encryption
- Implement row-level security where appropriate

#### API Security

- Implement rate limiting
- Validate request payloads
- Use API versioning
- Implement proper error handling (don't leak sensitive info)
- Log security events

#### Dependencies

- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security advisories
- Use `npm audit` regularly
- Pin dependency versions
- Review dependency changes

### For Deployment

#### Server Security

- Keep OS and software updated
- Configure firewall properly
- Disable unnecessary services
- Use SSH keys (not passwords)
- Implement fail2ban or similar
- Regular security audits

#### SSL/TLS Configuration

- Use TLS 1.2 or higher
- Use strong cipher suites
- Enable HSTS
- Implement certificate pinning
- Regular certificate renewal

#### Application Security

- Set security headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Strict-Transport-Security
- Disable server version disclosure
- Implement request size limits
- Use secure session configuration

#### Monitoring & Logging

- Enable application logging
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular log review
- Implement intrusion detection

#### Backup & Recovery

- Regular encrypted backups
- Test backup restoration
- Store backups securely
- Implement disaster recovery plan
- Document recovery procedures

## Known Security Considerations

### OpenAI API Integration

- API key must be kept secure
- Rate limiting should be implemented
- Monitor API usage
- Sanitize data sent to API
- Handle API errors gracefully

### Email Account Integration

- OAuth2 tokens must be encrypted at rest
- IMAP passwords must be encrypted
- Implement token refresh
- Validate email content before processing
- Prevent email injection attacks

### Product Catalog Upload

- Validate file formats strictly
- Limit file sizes
- Scan for malicious content
- Parse files safely
- Implement access controls

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- Implement data minimization
- Provide data export functionality
- Implement data deletion
- Maintain audit logs
- Obtain user consent
- Privacy policy must be clear

### Data Retention

- Define retention policies
- Implement automatic data purging
- Allow user data deletion
- Backup retention policy
- Log retention policy
